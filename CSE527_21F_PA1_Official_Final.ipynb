Perform an 11x11 convolution with sigma = 3 from question 1 using this scheme. You can still use `filter2D` to convolve the images with each of the 1D kernels. Verify that you get the same results with what you did with 2D kernels by computing the difference image between the results from the two methods. This difference image should be close to black.
